## Is there a problem?

 - Sometimes a big challenge
   - they feel like they're talking to a different species
   - techies enjoy a blast of code or algorithms
     - but what about everybody else?

 - Brain surgeons often can't code, but that doesn't mean they're not stupid, or not technical

# Is what you know important?

 - message deseerves to be presented so that it can get through

# Does it matter?

 - 7 red lines - all perpendicular: some with green ink, some transparent.  Can you do that?
 - run.

 - normally people you need to communicate aren't idiots like this
   - but it can feel like they are because there's such a mismatch of expectations

 - Steve Jobs didn't ever code

 - sometimes funders are non-coders

 - Communication  sets expectations

 - Domain knowledge is important: example is IoT
   - need to talk to people designing sensors, working out what the ultimate goals are, etc.

 - Aadhaar Project: Largest biometric DB in the world
   - Unique 12-digit number for each person in India
   - Runs on NoSQL database MapR-DB
     - has to be available 24-7, ms latency.
     - Trying to change society in india
       - make normal transations, banking, welfare, available to everyone
       - needs to allow people to do these transations anywhere, any time.

 - Talking across teams
   - good news: tech skills are widely valuable
   - bad news: hard to do

 - show that your ideas are of value

 - Lesson 3:
   - adjust style of presentation
   - story
   - more than one way to explain things
   - visuals, diagrams

 - Best ways to communicate
   - language
   - interactive; initiate conversation with audience, get them talking about what they know, what theirer ideas are.
   - empathise with what your audience sees / hears

 - Example: Apache Drill 1.0 just release
   - built it, now want people to use it
   - message changes from how it's built, to what it can do

 - Test what people see in your message
   - Diagram; testing showed that people couldn't see what was going on - highlighting what you want them to focus on

 - Go more than half way to share understanding

 - Example:
   - how to build a simple recommended
   - data you should look at is what people do
   - so, talk about what people do with examples
   - diagram representing relationship between people and users worked better with cartoon drawing labels

 - Respect the other team
   - helps to understand what they're missing the point of

 - Homework Assignment:
   - make a diagram about something that's important to you
   - make a 5 minute presentation for a person

 - Ebooks from MapR written in these styles (some available free form MapR website)

 - Plug; please help support women in technology

# Question

 - Some people don't understand why they need to understand things
   - Comes up more often than we'd like. Don't just meet half-way, go further. Try and identify the issues:
     - eg, fear of math, think you're a geek and haev nothing relevant, etc
     - address that
